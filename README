Hello there.  Thanks for cloning our TravelGuide repository!

To automatically, just visit: http://localhost/travelGuide/index.php
and enter your mysql root username and password.

If this does not work correctly, then source traveldb.sql in your mysql
shell, delete index.php, and rename real_index.php to index.php.
