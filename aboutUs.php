We are currently accepting submissions for our name, until then, we are TravelGuide. <br/><br/>
This is a project hosted by Amy, Kelsie, Erin, and myself(Rebecca) for our CPSC 350:Databases course at the University of Mary Washington.<br/><br/>
Some of us are traveled; some of us are not, but we are working to implement this site as a user-friendly way to access information and pictures
of popular tourist destinations around the world.   <br/><br/>
This site is currently under construction, but as things are implemented feel free to create an account and browse what we've got thus far
concerning countries, cities, and attractions.  With an account, you will eventually be able to upload pictures, comment on attractions and pictures,
and save a location as a favorite.  Don't see a country, city, or attraction you want to see here?  As a registered user you will be able to request
it to be added to our database, and then I'm sure granted no unforeseen circumstances one of us would be happy to oblige you!
